User's Guide

When starting the game, the user can observe the "Settings" window. 

The player can enter his name, choose the number of colors he wants to play with. The more colors - the harder it is to play the game. 

After selecting the settings and choosing a name, it is necessary to click on the "Enter" button to start the game. 

A game window appears in front of the player. On it you can see: The main playing field, the name - entered players, the number of colors selected, the number of points scored, and the "Bomb" button.

To play, you need to select the desired cell and move it to the white field. For best results, it is worth thinking through your moves ahead, to the extent permitted. When a line is destroyed, the player receives 5 points. 

"Bomb" helps the player get out of a difficult situation. When pressing the button, the user must click on the desired spot on the field, and the clicked cell, as well as all cells around, in a radius of one, will be painted white, thereby freeing up space for further action. 

The game ends when there are less than 4 white squares on the whole field.
